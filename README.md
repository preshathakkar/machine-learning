Machine Learning Problems solved using Apache Spark

This Repository consists of several different machine learning problems that were solved with Apache Spark and converted in python scripts.

1. Apache Log Analysis (nasa-apache-log.py) : 
  The Apache Logs from Nasa's website are analysized to find specific data such as Top URLs which return 404 errors, Average number of daily requests per hosts, Average Daily Requests per Unique Host, Number of unique daily hosts, etc.
  This would help to design better servers and also help in analysizing requests from users to provide more relevant data.

2. Prediction With Linear Regression (linear-reg-UCI.py) :
  Prediction through a common supervised learning pipeline,using a subset of the [Million Song Dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YearPredictionMSD). The goal is to train a linear regression model to predict the release year of a song given a set of audio features.

3. Prediction Using Alternating Least Squares method (movieRatings-prediction-Netflix.py) :
  Using a subset dataset of 500,000 ratings from the [movielens 10M stable benchmark rating dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), I have trained a prediction model based on the some basic techniques and Alternating Least Mean Squares Method to recommend movies for the user depending on previous movie ratings of the user.
  
4. Click-Through Rate Prediction (CTR-criteo.py) :
  Creating a click-through rate (CTR) prediction pipeline using [Criteo Labs](http://labs.criteo.com/) dataset that was used for a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge).
  
5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA-neuroscience.py) : 
  An exploratory analysis of neuroscience data, specifically using principal component analysis (PCA) and feature-based aggregation. The dataset used for this analysis is of light-sheet imaging recorded by the [Ahrens Lab](http://www.janelia.org/lab/ahrens-lab) at Janelia Research Campus, and hosted on the CodeNeuro [data repository](http://datasets.codeneuro.org).
  The dataset is generated by studying the movement of a larval [zebrafish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrafish), an animal that is especially useful in neuroscience because it is transparent, making it possible to record activity over its entire brain using a technique called [light-sheet microscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_sheet_fluorescence_microscopy). Have worked with time-varying images containing patterns of the zebrafish's neural activity as it is presented with a moving visual pattern. Different stimuli induce different patterns across the brain, and I have used exploratory analyses to identify these patterns.
